      The goal of this tools is to try and figure out when, if ever, deliberate exposure could be used as a technique to prevent a disease from spreading. Open this page with a chrome browser, and open up the console. try the commands `test_infect();` and `test_no_infect();`. test_infect returns a slightly higher number. This shows that a larger fraction of the people survived because of deliberately infecting some medical workers, and people with critical jobs to maintain the economy.
